\section{Mathematics} Quantum computing relies heavly principles of linear algebra as a qubit 
is a vector. To better understand it, this section will delve into the mathematical tools used
throughout the project.

\begin{subsection}
    Qubits are repesented by 2d Vectors. It is common for them to 
    be repesented using  dirac notation.    
\end{subsection}
\begin{subsection}[Tensor Product]
    The tensor product or Kronker product is a bilinear map that allows
    us the concataate or glue qubits into strings of infomation. The tensor product 
    also allows us to build quantum algothims in parrelell.
    The resaoning is that the tensor product of two qubits or gates creates a 
    third larger Hilbert space from the other two
